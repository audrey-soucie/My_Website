# Hello Internet! This is Audrey
>My name is Audrey. I am a freshman in college majoring in Computer science. I like video games, and books, and movies, and other things.

>College life is a bit tiring, but fun I guess. What else is there to say? I have half a tank of gas in my car, and I need to clean my apartment. That is all I suppose, farewell!
